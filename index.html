        <p style="margin-top: 0.6cm;">
            We had a plan of trip to Goa but my father cancled it on my result day after seeing my Report Card as I got
            only
            66%. I was too much sad on that day not because I got less marks but because our trip
            was canclled. but then I thought to spend my summer vacation productively soo before going to sleep I made a
            plan of
            waking up early at 12:00 noon and then learn something. So the next day I
            woked up at 12:30PM actully I did not wokeup myself but my mom forcefully and violently did that not that
            much
            violence just a slap. Then I had my Lunch and then went in my gully to play but
            none of my friends were there to play as they are State board student and I was the only CBSE student in my
            gully(sad life ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­). so I decided to play with the street dogs which was obviously bad(fuddu)
            decision. So we played pakdam-pakdi some times I used to run behined them, sometimes they used to run
            behined
            me,
            sometime I used to bite them,sometime they used to bite me and in this
            way I spent my afternoon . Then in evening I thought to do something productive so I started watching Lok
            Sabha's
            vedio as it teaches us how to tell lies confidently, how to fool many people
            at the same time, how to prevent overself from being humilated(Rahul Gandhi),and most required skill how to
            tell
            lie
            when teacher asks for homework and my most favourite actor in
            Lok Sabha show was Mr Naredra Modi as his acting skills are execllent and Rahul Gandhi is also great
            comedian.
            So
            After dinner I started fighting(without any reson) with sister as I was
            deeply influenced by Lok sabha and the Fight ended with my dad shout and mom's slippers. Then I went again
            to
            play
            in gully but the stree dogs were sleeping so I came back at home and
            started watching NetFlix shows on Telegram. As I had decided to sleep Early so I went to sleep on 2:30 AM
            and
            this
            over-productive routine continued for a long time but 2, 3 days before
            school opening I came to know about summer vacation homework so I decided to not doing homework and make a
            execuse
            when teacher asks for it as I had became exepert in it by watching Lok sabha
            so at last I would like to say that Early to Bed and to Rise make's a man heathy, wealthy and wise is
            tottaly a
            lie
            cause I tried this myself but nothing happned. Thank you for wasting your precious
            time by reading this story/paragraph/essay or whatever
